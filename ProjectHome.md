PicturePerfect is an Android Application. The user simply uses his or her Android phone to snap a picture, triggering our app to obtain a burst of still frames. These frames are collected and analyzed using edge and feature detection algorithms. The user is able to choose the best possible face for each subject from the burst of photographs and subsequently combine them into one ideal photograph. Additionally, the user is able to remove unwanted objects from the background that may have been unwittingly caught in the picture. Since the final photograph is returned to the user and appears unadulterated due to the seamless collaging of our application.
